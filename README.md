# web_scraping-
This project is done using beautiful soup to replicate a search engine.

The project is done to replicate Google scholar but limited to a particular webpage but specialised to retrieve only papers/books published by a member of the School of Economics, Finance and Accounting (SEFA) at Coventry University:
https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/organisations/school-of-economics-finance-and-accounting


This project makes use of a web crawler to scrap relevant data from the webpage. 
It exacts data such as Authors, Publication Year, Title etc. 

Modules used in processing our data frame after being parsed from the website are :
1. NLTK STOPWORDS
2. LEMMATIZATION
3. INDEXING (Inverted Index) 
4. A QUERY PROCESSOR
